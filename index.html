				<p id="sideNote"><em>Side note about Sharon:</em> Sharon is a licensed vet tech and her shop is fully insured.</p>
				<h2>Pet Grooming:</h2>
				<p>Every dog and cat, regardless of size, breed, age or coat type, needs to be groomed on a regular basis. We do ask for you to set up an appointment with us, and tell us a little bit about your pet. PLEASE if you know your pet bites, we need to know before you drop him or her off.</p>

				<h2>Pet Sitting/Day Care:</h2>
				<p>I felt that there was a need for quality pet care in home with a personal touch. Regular kennels disrupt a dog&#39;s system, sometimes physically and emotionally. There are too many dogs and cats with no personal time. Not to worry, Sharon&#39;s Pet Sitting provides doggie day care where you can drop off your pet for the day to play with other dogs that come to day care, or we also provide in home pet sitting. We can stay all night or stop by several times a day.</p> 
				<p>Pet sitting includes:</p> 
				<ul>
					<li>Personal Time With Your Pet</li> 
					<li>Play Time</li> 
					<li>Many Walks</li> 
					<li>We Will Even Pick Up Your Mail For You</li> 
					<li>And Much More!</li> 
				</ul>
